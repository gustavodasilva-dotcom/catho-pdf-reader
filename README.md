## What does it do?

This application -- a _.NET 7 Worker Service_ -- reads (specific) data from PDF curriculum files from **Catho** and saves it in an Excel file.

The following table presents the data read from the PDF file:

| Data name (in portuguese) | Description                               							  |
| --------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|

## How does it work?

The process works in the following order:

- The application lists the PDF files to be processed in the \ToProcess directory;
- After listing the files, the application extracts the data from the PDF files;
- After extracting, the application moves the read PDF files to the \Processed directory, and then saves the generated Excel file at the \GeneretedExcels directory.
